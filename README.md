## Learnings

Through this project, I learned how to break out sections of an application into individual modules to ease the development process. This was especially helpful for pulling out sections of the application that were not essential to the logic-flow, such as the questions object and the MySQL connection. Additionally, I practiced using Promises for the asyncronous interactions with the database, which cleaned up the interface.
